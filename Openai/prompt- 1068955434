OpenAI response for prompt: what are Fibonacci numbers using artificial intelligence write Fibonacci series 
 ******************************* 

Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The Fibonacci sequence can be mathematically defined as:

- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n > 1 \)

The initial numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

### Generating the Fibonacci Series using Python Code

Here's a simple Python code snippet to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_series = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_series.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_series

# Set the number of terms you want
num_terms = 10
print(f"The first {num_terms} terms of the Fibonacci series are: {fibonacci(num_terms)}")
```

When you run this code
