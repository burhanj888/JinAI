OpenAI response for prompt: using artificial intelligence write Fibonacci series 
 ******************************* 

Certainly! Here's an example of how to generate the Fibonacci series using Python, a popular programming language for working with artificial intelligence and data:

### Fibonacci Series in Python

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

# Example usage
n_terms = 10  # Number of terms in the Fibonacci series
fibonacci_series = fibonacci(n_terms)
print(fibonacci_series)
```

### Explanation:
1. We define a function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n`, which is the number of terms in the Fibonacci series to generate.
2. We initialize the list `fib_sequence` to store the Fibonacci numbers, and two variables `a` (0) and `b` (1) to hold the current and next Fibonacci numbers.
3. We use a loop to iterate `n` times, appending the current Fibonacci number (`a`) to the list.
4. We then update `a` and `b` for the next iteration, calculating the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two numbers.
5. Finally, the function
